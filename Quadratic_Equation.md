-----------------------------Quadratic Equation -----------------------------



A quadratic equation is a second-degree polynomial equation in a single variable written like  this : 

                                             "ax2+bx+c=0"

where a, b, c are constant but if a ==0 that equation can't be a quadratic equation . When a=0 the equation turns into a linear equation.



A quadratic equation can have two, one, or no real solutions depending on the value of its discriminant. D = b2−4ac

If D > 0 there are two distinct real roots.

If D = 0 there is one real root (repeated root).

If D < 0 there are no real roots (the roots are complex)

Quadratic Formula : 

x = −b ± rootover (b2−4ac) by 2a
